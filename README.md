# Venture Forth
This is a slightly silly [text adventure game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction) about one hungover student, a house full of dirty laundry, and the voyage of discovery he must embark upon in order to clean them. It is written in various stages as part of a tutorial on how to structure a "proper" [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) application, as must tutorials often forget to address this last step. This application illustrates how one should arrange code, unit-tests, performance tests (using benchmarking) and documentation all within one project. It also, in later chapters, shows how all Haskell applications are ultimately structured as Monads. Hopefully, this will help future Haskell learners with their first applications.

The application development has been broken into chapters, with a writeup in the `docs` folder, and code in the `chap1`, `chap2` etc. folders. While this could have been done with tags, it's a bit easier for users just to browse code here on GitHub. 

At time of writing, I'm still arranging hosting for the website which will hold the blog with these blog posts. Once arranged, I'll put the URL here.

## Building the project
The final project is in the latest chapter. It can be built using cabal, using the usual `cabal build` command. However fuller descriptions can be found in the `docs` folder.

##Â History
Venture Forth is not a new game, and certainly not one of my own making. It was originally written in 1993 as part of a tutorial series on Locomative Basic in issues [93](https://archive.org/details/amstrad-action-093), [94](https://archive.org/details/amstrad-action-094), [95](https://archive.org/details/amstrad-action-095) and [96](https://archive.org/details/amstrad-action-096) of [Amstrad Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_Action) magazine.
