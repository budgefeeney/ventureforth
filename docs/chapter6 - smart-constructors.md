# Venture Forth: Smart Constructors

This is the sixth part of the [Venture Forth tutorial](fixme) on how to create a full Haskell application. The previous part concluded our explanation of [how to layout modules and avoid name clashes](fixme). Code for this part can be found [on github](https://github.com/budgefeeney/ventureforth/tree/master/chap6)

In this part of the tutorial we'll

  * Discuss the dangers of "stringly typed" values, and how to avoid them
 * Quickly introduce how one uses regular expressions in Haskell
 * Discuss how to use private constructors, safe constructor functions, and constructor-views to ensure that all types contain only valid data.
